# About

This is yet another Rails CMS. The idea being that I can git clone it as a starting point for all 2015 projects.

## Aims

The CMS should be able to:

* Let admins sign in and create articles
* Have a range of static pages
* Have a contact form that sends emails and/or registers interest in the back-office
* Have a user focused user backend that just focuses on very simple edits

## What's with the name, Tern?

An Arctic Tern is a bird.

The Arctic Tern is a member of a very exclusive animal club, it can be found at different times at both poles.
